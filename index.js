// Examples of Modulus (along with other operators)
//    console.log(5 % 2);

//    console.log(39 < 23);
// to check if 2 things are considered to be equal...
// It checks the VALUE and TYPE
//    console.log(2 === 3);
//    console.log(2 === 2);
// A single = means ASSIGNMENT, while a === means CHECK for both VALUE and TYPE (STRICT EQUALITY)
//    console.log(2 !== 3); // Obviously !== means not equal

// EXPRESSION is anything that evaluates to a value
// STATEMENTS combine EXPRESSIONS with keywords and other syntax
const x = 3;
if (x === 3) {
  // {}s establish SCOPE of the code.
  console.log("X is 3!");
} else {
  console.log("X is not 3!");
